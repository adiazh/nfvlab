summary: minimalist web framework for the WAI server interface
maintainer: ealbedi <ealbedi@ubuntu>
description: |
  Simple is a "framework-less" web framework for Haskell web applications
  based on the WAI server interface (f.ex. for use with the warp
  server). Simple does not enforce a particular structure or paradigm
  for web applications. Rather, Simple contains tools to help you create
  your own patterns (or re-create existing ones). Simple is minimalist,
  providing a lightweight base - the most basic Simple app is little
  more than a WAI 'Application' with some routing logic. Everything else
  (f.ex. authentication, controllers, persistence, caching, etc.) is
  provided in composable units, so you can include only the ones you
  need in your app, and easily replace them with your own components.
